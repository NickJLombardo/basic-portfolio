     Hello,

    My names Nick Lombardo, and I would like to express my interest in the assistant property manager position.         
     I am currently working towards obtaining my real estate license.
    I have most recently worked in the UCLA athletic department,
    but I have moved back to the Philadelphia area and looking to gain experience in real estate. 
    
    
    Prior to UCLA, my experience includes working as an Office Manager at Nutrition Unlimited 
    in South Philly were I managed over 500+ clients across 12 locations.           
    </p>
